3. **Tim Smoking Cool in the Movie Theater (Best Version)**
   - **Prompt**: "A flat 2D cartoon illustration of Tim, the red and white striped popcorn bucket character, sitting front and center in a classic movie theater seat. Tim is facing directly toward the viewer, looking effortlessly cool in his black trench coat draped casually over his tall, rectangular popcorn body. His dark sunglasses sit confidently on his face, angled just enough to reflect the movie playing on the screen, with a hint of a sly grin beneath them. Tim is sitting with his legs crossed in a classic laid-back pose, one leg resting atop the other, with his white-laced high-top sneakers prominently displayed. His left hand, wearing a white glove, is resting on the armrest, while his right hand, also gloved, holds a cigarette, smoke curling up into the air in playful swirls. There’s a small glowing ember at the tip of the cigarette, and the smoke forms whimsical popcorn-shaped rings, adding a fun twist to the classic 'smoking' vibe.
