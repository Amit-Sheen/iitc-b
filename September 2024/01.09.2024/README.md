Key points of today:
1 - In Postman, I can add a base URL which will act as the environment for that specific run, making the API calls more dynamic and easier to execute.
2 - Postman allows to use dynamic global variables to make the tests more dynamic.
3 - Postman is mostly used for QA Automations and manually QA.
4 - Task assignment from the zoom class to do a QA test for more than few different methods and to record their results by request data, response, parameters, headers, etc...
